Comparison-Based Sorting in JavaScript
Comparison-based sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are widely used to arrange elements in a specific order based on comparisons between pairs of elements. JavaScript provides several built-in methods and libraries that implement these sorting algorithms efficiently



Conclusion
Understanding comparison-based sorting algorithms is crucial for efficiently managing and manipulating data in JavaScript applications. Whether using built-in methods, library functions, or custom implementations, choosing the right sorting algorithm can significantly impact the performance and stability of your application.
